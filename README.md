# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project classifies sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine" using machine learning techniques. It is based on the Sonar dataset, which contains 60 features derived from sonar signals and a binary target variable.

## Features of the Project:
- **Dataset**: The Sonar dataset, with 60 features and a binary classification target (Rock/Mine).
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression (and possibly others).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Data Collection and Preprocessing.
  2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  3. Building and training a machine learning model.
  4. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

## Results:
The model achieves a satisfactory accuracy in predicting the class of sonar signals, showcasing the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
